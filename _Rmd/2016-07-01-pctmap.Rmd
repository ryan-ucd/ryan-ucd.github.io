title: "Pacific Crest Trail Map"

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(screenshot.force = FALSE)
```

This is a test of a leaflet map made in R, and ported over via jekyll to this post.
It's a fairly simple map of the Pacific Crest Trail, which I hope to hike in it's entirety one day.
Maybe not all at once, but certainly in segments. It's a truly amazing trail, I've done chunks of it, including the John Muir Trail and a decent stretch south of Ebbetts Pass.

your.map  # to embed separately, use an Rmd and embed then render to html
