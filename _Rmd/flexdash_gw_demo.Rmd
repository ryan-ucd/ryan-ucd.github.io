#### **BACKGROUND & MOTIVATION**

- California's Central Valley is the state's most agriculturally intensive region and heavily dependent on groundwater. It is also home to nearly half of the state's domestic well reliant individuals. 

- During the 2012-2016 drought, the state received nearly 2,500 domestic wells failure reports, the majority of which were in the Central Valley. This left thousands of people without a reliable source of drinking water, and drew [national attention ](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/business/energy-environment/california-farmers-dig-deeper-for-water-sipping-their-neighbors-dry.html){target="blank"} and [state intervention ](https://www.fresnobee.com/news/local/water-and-drought/article98224037.html){target="blank"}.  

- Hundreds of thousands to more than 1.4 million Californians rely on domestic wells for drinking water.
 

#### **QUESTIONS**

- How will a future drought affect domestic well failure in California's Central Valley?  

- Are well failures more associated with particular social drivers of vulnerability, like income? 

- Can machine learning models explain the climatic drivers of domestic well failure and extrapolate failure probability across the Central Valley?
<!-- - Can machine learning models predict domestic well failure from climatological variables, and if so, how will domestic well vulnerability be affected in a changing climate?  -->


### A spatial model driven by open data from public agencies was used to assess the vulnerability of domestic wells in California's Central Valley to failure. {data-commentary-width=400}

```{r, out.width = '100%', out.height= '100%'}

#### **DATA & MODEL** 

- Seasonal groundwater level measurements *[left panel]* from the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) were used to interpolate water levels *[middle panel]* representing the shallow, to semi-confined Central Valley aquifer system.  

- Combined with DWR domestic well construction data *[right panel]*, a spatial model of well failure was built and calibrated to actual well failure in during the 2012-2016 drought.  

- As groundwater levels fall, shallow wells are more at risk of drying out and failing than deep wells.

### The modeled **2012-2016** drought caused nearly 2,500 domestic well failures in the Central Valley, with most of the impact experienced by households in the Tulare Basin.  {data-commentary-width=400}

#### **2012-2016 DROUGHT**

#### **Hydrologic Impact**

- Predicted failure is shown in this interactive map. Spatial patterns in predicted well failure during the 2012-2016 drought were very similar to wells that failed during the actual drought.  

- Toggle layers on and off in the upper-left legend box.

- When zoomed in, click points on the map to expand information on wells. Red points indicate dry wells or well failures, and blue points indicate wells that didn't fail.

- **Failure Ratio**: the predicted ratio of # dry wells/ # total wells. Hovering labels show the Bulletin 118 Subbasin name, followed by the dry well count, the total number of active wells, and the percent failure.  

- **Dry Well Count**: count of wells in the WCR dataset that the model predicted to go dry (fail). 

- **Dry Well Density**: density of wells in the WCR dataset (# dry wells / 100 sqkm) that the model predicted to go dry (fail). 

- **Dry Wells**: wells in the WCR dataset that the model predicted to go dry (fail).  

-	**Active wells**: wells in the WCR dataset that the model predicts stay active, or not dry.  


### The **2012-2016** drought affected low-income areas more than areas at or above the median income. More than half of well failures in severely disadvantaged areas were less than 1 mile from a water system. {data-commentary-width=400}

#### **2012-2016 DROUGHT**

#### **Socioeconomic Impact**

```{r}
t1 <- read_rds("data/table_1.rds")
t1
```


- **Well outages reported to the State** represent our best, and in some instances only, sense of the magnitude of the issues faced by domestic well users during the drought.  

- About **1.5 times more well failures were reported by households in disadvantaged (DAC) and severely disadvantaged (SDAC) census tracts**, compared to communities at or above the Median Household Income (MHI+).  

- Some point out that **private well failures were under-reported**, suggesting that the socioeconomic impact could be much worse. Reasons for not reporting include a distrust of government, fear of the consequence of reporting, and lack of awareness about available assistance. Additionally, households able to resolve their own well failures had little incentive to report or ask the county or state for help. 

- **More than half** of the well failures in severely disadvantaged areas were **less than 1 mile** from a water system.  

- A statistically significant difference between the mean distance from well failures to the closest water system was found between the SDAC group and the two other income groups. See the [Supporting Analyses in the  Appendix](https://richpauloo.github.io/flexdash.html#appendix){target="blank"} for more details on [tests of statistical significance and county-level summary statistics](https://richpauloo.github.io/stat.html){target="blank"}.  

- **Connecting well failures to public water systems** was a feasible yet sometimes costly long-term solution for many households affected by the 2012-2016 drought. Given the proximity of reported failures to nearby systems suggests an area for closer study and perhaps intervention.  

- Each group exhibits **outliers**, which can be 2.5 - 7.5 miles from a water system, which shows how **many domestic well reliant households are remote and rural**.  

** As we don't know the actual MHI of households filing reports, this analysis relies on associating census tract MHI data with reported outages, and is used to illustrate the types of impact analysis possible. Those reporting to counties and states were often unable to self-finance solutions.  





### A **future 1-4 year long drought** would cause **thousands** of domestic well failures, affecting **tens of thousands** of people in the Central Valley alone.  {data-commentary-width=400}

#### **FUTURE DROUGHT**

#### **Hydrologic Impact**

```{r}
library(kableExtra)
library(knitr)

# create table of drought results
data.frame(drought_length = paste(1:4,c("yr","yrs","yrs","yrs")),
           n_well_failures = formatC(c(1282,2321,3370,4296), 
                                       big.mark = ",")) %>% 
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))
```

- To explore the impact of future drought on domestic well failure, a **4 year long drought was simulated** based on the **groundwater level change observed during 2012-2016**. **Intermediate droughts of 1 to 3 years** were also simulated. All simulated droughts begin **January 2018**, and assume no interventions to alleviate outages or slow groundwater level declines.  

- Across California's Central Valley alone, a **1-4 year drought** would cause  **thousands** of domestic well failures, affecting **tens of thousands** of people.  

- A **4 year** drought would have **twice** as many well failures compared to 2012-2016 due to **already low groundwater levels**.  

- The southeastern Tulare Basin and northern basins are most susceptible to domestic well failure.

- Due to differences in historical groundwater level decline, starting groundwater levels, and the distribution of well depths per region, some regions experience more than 10 times the density of well failure of other regions.

- Another 4 year drought would lead to as much as 9-10 well failures per 100 square kilometers in the most adversely affected regions.


### A **future 1-4 year long drought** would affect MHI+ and (DAC + SDAC) groups similarly, but these groups will differ in their ability to cope with well failure. {data-commentary-width=400}

- SDAC and DAC well failures tend to be as far away or further away from water systems as MHI+ failures in future drought scenarios.     

- In terms of count, future droughts will tend to impact MHI+ and (DAC + SDAC) communities similarly, but these communities will differ in their ability to cope with the challenges associated with losing a primary source of drinking water.  
 
 
### **Machine learning** was used to assess the **climatic drivers** of well failure. Future machine learning aims to scope the influence of **climate change** on well failure probability.  {data-commentary-width=400}

<!-- ### **Machine learning models** were used to scope the vulnerability of domestic wells to **future climate change**. Increases in well failure are predicted, mainly due to **projected temperature increase**. {data-commentary-width=400} -->

#### **CLIMATIC VULNERABILITY**

Results from the spatial model were used to train an **ensemble machine learning classifier** on 56 climatic and geologic variables to predict present day well failure across the Central Valley. See the [Appendix](https://richpauloo.github.io/flexdash.html#appendix){target="blank"} for more information on the methods and approach.  

- The map shows extrapolated **present day domestic well failure probability** across the Central Valley using the climate driven machine learning models.  

- The best models achieve a test accuracy of around 85%.  

- The 10 most important variables used by the ensemble classifier were:
    + 1-5: Maximum temperature in June, May, September, October, November
    + 6: Mean Diurnal Range (average of the monthly temperature range)
    + 7: Temperature Seasonality
    + 8: Annual Precipitation
    + 9: Temperature Annual Range
    + 10: Maximum temperature in April

- Of the 56 variables used by the ensemble classifier, the **5 most important are the maximum temperature during summer and months that border summer**. Three bioclimatic indicators are also present in the top 10 and describe variations in temperature at the monthly, seasonal and annual scales; these variations covary with drought. In total, **well failure is mainly predicted by higher temperatures in the spring, fall, and summer as well as swings in temperatures**.

- Precipitation isn't as important as temperature a predictor. This makes sense because the Central Valley rarely sees rain, and **groundwater recharge in the Central Valley is mainly driven by managed surface water and pumped, then reapplied groundwater**.

- Work in progress includes extending these predictions under **future climate change scenarios**.  


<!-- #### **CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY**  -->

<!-- - Results from the spatial model were used to train an **ensemble machine learning classifier** on 56 climatic and geologic variables to predict future well failure in a changing climate. See the [Appendix](https://richpauloo.github.io/flexdash.html#appendix){target="blank"} for more information on the methods and approach.   -->

<!-- - **Red values indicate higher relative change** in well failure probability (baseline: 2017); **blue values indicate lower relative change** in well failure probability.  -->

<!-- - We see **up to a ~60% positive and ~40% negative change** in well failure in **2050 and 2070**, and across different RCPs. On the whole, we observe **more increases in well failure than decreases in well failure**. -->

<!-- - The 10 most important variables used by the ensemble classifier were: -->
<!--     + 1-5: Maximum temperature in June, May, September, October, November   -->
<!--     + 6: Mean Diurnal Range (average of the monthly temperature range)   -->

Vulnerable Communities
=========================================

Column {data-width=700}
-------------------------------------
    
####  **IN 2012, CALIFORNIA LEGISLATIVELY RECOGNIZED THE HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER.** 

> *"Every human being has the right to safe, clean, affordable, and accessible water adequate for human consumption, cooking, and sanitary purposes".* [- Assembly Bill 685](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/hr2w/){target="blank"}  


While many households committed to maintaining and relying on their private wells, even during a drought, there are others who haven't been able to access more reliable and centralized water provisions. Many of these [vulnerable communities have historically been left without access to safe water](https://regionalchange.ucdavis.edu/publication/water-justice){target="blank"}. Fortunately, many counties and non-profit agencies are committed to working with domestic well users. For example during the drought, [Self Help Enterprises](https://www.selfhelpenterprises.org/programs/community-development/drought-response/){target="blank"} coordinated loan programs and installed temporary household tanks on properties with dry wells. And Stanislaus County funded a domestic well financial assistance program where households at [150% of their county MHI](http://www.stancounty.com/er/pdf/groundwater/loan-application.pdf){target="blank"} ($83k/year) were eligible.

#### **ARE YOU CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR DOMESTIC WELL FAILING DURING A DROUGHT?**

Here are some resources that may help:  

- The [State Water Resources Control Board](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/gama/well_owners.html){target="blank"}, lists resources for domestic wells owners including information on water quality testing and identifying whether your domestic well is near a [nitrate-impacted well](https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/water_issues/programs/nitrate_project/nitrate_tool/){target="blank"}. Many counties may also have volunteer water well testing programs, contact your [local Department of Environmental Health](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Pages/LocalHealthServicesAndOffices.aspx){target="blank"} to find county-specific resources.   

- **Report an outage to the state**: During the drought, the state established a [Household Water Supply Shortage Reporting system](https://mydrywatersupply.water.ca.gov/report/){target="blank"}. Individuals reliant on domestic wells or non-profits supporting these individuals can report outages there. 

- Limited financial resources for domestic wells are available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) [Rural Development program](https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs-services/programs-services-individuals){target="blank"}, to both individuals and non-profits like the [RCAC](https://www.rcac.org/lending/household-water-well-loans/){target="blank"}.

About
=========================================

#### **TEAM** 

This project was made by **function(water, data){science}**, for the 2018 [California Water Data Challenge](http://waterchallenge.data.ca.gov/){target="blank"}. Team Members include:  

- Rich Pauloo, PhD Candidate in Hydrology at UC Davis  
- Amanda Fencl, PhD Candidate in Geography at UC Davis  
- Herv? Guillon, Research Scholar at UC Davis  
- Alvar Escriva-Bou, Research Fellow at Public Policy Institute of California  

***  


#### **FUTURE DIRECTIONS**

The team expects to write 3 peer-reviewed papers covering:  

- A review of the spatial model used to reproduce the 2012-2016 drought with future drought scenarios, and different groundwater management scenarios under the [Sustainable Groundwater Management Act](https://water.ca.gov/Programs/Groundwater-Management/SGMA-Groundwater-Management){target="blank'}.  
- A sociodemographic analysis of impacted and vulnerable communities with public policy recommendations.  
- The use of machine learning to investigate the impact of climate change on domestic well failure vulnerability.  

It is the team's hope that these findings positively influence local and state policies concerning drought preparedness in areas where we find domestic well dependent communities.  Given the extent of reported domestic well failure and ongoing the overexploitation of groundwater aquifers, communities adversely impacted by the recent drought may remain vulnerable without appropriate interventions.

#### **APPROACH**

##### 2012-2016 Drought

- Using the location of domestic wells and their estimated pump depth, a well is considered dry or failed if the groundwater level during the 2012-2016 drought falls below the level of the pump.

##### Future Droughts

- 1, 2, 3, and 4 yearlong droughts were simulated by scaling the 4 year groundwater level change observed during 2012-2016 by factors of 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1 respectively.  
- The mean of Spring and Fall 2017 groundwater levels was used as the initial condition for groundwater level.  
- As before, a well fails when the groundwater level in a drought scenario fell below the level of the pump.

##### Socioeconomic Impact

- Census data used DWR's [Disadvantaged Communities (DAC) Census Tract layer](https://data.cnra.ca.gov/dataset/census-tract-disadvantaged-communities-2016){target="blank"}, which uses the American Community Survey (ACS) 2012-2016 5-year estimates for median household income to assign tracts as DAC or not.  
- The 2016 MHI was $63,783. Our income level categories are scaled accordingly as:  
    + **MHI+** : at or above MHI    
    + **DAC** : 80% of MHI   
    + **SDAC** : 60% of MHI  
- The distance between each reported well failure during the 2012-2016 drought and its **closest Community Water System** centroid was measured, representing how far each well failure was to a more reliable source of water or potential long term solution.  
- Census tract **median annual incomes** were assigned to each well failure.

##### Machine Learning

- An **ensemble machine learning classifier** was designed to **predict the failing state of wells** from **56 variables** describing monthly temperature, monthly precipitation and bioclimatic indices (e.g. mean annual temperature). The failing state of more than **36,000 wells** was derived from the spatial model to train and validate **65 initial machine learning classifiers**. The 4 most accurate classifiers were combined into a final ensemble classifier.  
<!-- - To forecast the influence of future climate change on well failure, the ensemble classifier was applied to IPCC climate predictions for 2050 and 2070 under all 4 greenhouse gas concentration scenarios (RCP). For each year and RCP, data from up to 19 climate models was used by the ensemble classifier to predict well failure. Then, comparing the ensemble classifier's predictions to present-day predictions (2017) as a baseline, we can understand how **increasing atmospheric carbon over time affects spatial trends in well failure**. -->
