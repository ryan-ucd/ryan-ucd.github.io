## Who Am I?

This is a first draft at a website for blogging/mapping/shiny-ing and more. I hope to link up to some of the research projects and data that I work with, and write about some of my field adventures. Stay tuned as I continue to build this out...still learning the tools of the trade, and I've put this off for way too long..

I'm a doctoral (PhD) candidate in Ecology at UC Davis, a researcher at the Center for Watershed Sciences, rafter, soccer player, beard wearer, quasi-musician, and chocolate/coffee lover. I prefer being outside in flowing water over most any other environment, and I study among many things, frogs.
