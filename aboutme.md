## Who Am I?

This is a first draft at a website for blogging/mapping/shiny-ing and more. I hope to link up to some of the research projects and data that I work with (some cool shiny apps [here][thermohydrographs] and [here][gosnerstages]), and write about some of my field adventures. Stay tuned as I continue to build this out...still learning the tools of the trade, and I've put this off for way too long. [^1]

I'm a doctoral (PhD) candidate in Ecology at UC Davis, a researcher at the Center for Watershed Sciences, rafter, soccer player, beard wearer, quasi-musician, and chocolate/coffee lover. I prefer being outside in flowing water over most any other environment, and I study among many things, frogs. In particular, I study *Rana boylii* (Foothill yellow-legged frogs) in California and Oregon.

When I'm not in the office coding (I'm an R junkie!), you can find me in places like this...looking for aquatic creatures. [^n]
