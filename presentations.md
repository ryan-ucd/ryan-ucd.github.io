## Talks & Slides

This is a newer addition to the site, but I'm hoping to post/convert most of my presentations over to `pdf` or `html` decks that folks can view here. If you are interested in a presentation and don't see it, please feel free to let me know. A big thumbs up to the [`xaringan`](https://slides.yihui.name/xaringan/) package in R/RStudio, which I have recently adopted as my default for presentations[^1].

[^1]: though many past presentations were done with powerpoint/keynote, I like the simplicity of html/pdf.
